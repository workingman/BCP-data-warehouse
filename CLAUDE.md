# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a new project directory with no existing codebase. As the project develops, this file should be updated with:

1. **Build and Development Commands** - Once a technology stack is chosen
2. **Project Architecture** - As the codebase structure emerges
3. **Testing Commands** - When tests are implemented
4. **Key Dependencies** - As external libraries are added

## Notes

Currently an empty repository at `/Users/gwr/dev/lightspeed/`
